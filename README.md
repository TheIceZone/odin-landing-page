# odin-landing-page
Project 2 for The Odin project; Make a landing page

This project involves recreating a landing page displayed in an image provided by The Odin Project (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) This project tests my HTML and CSS skills, as well as my ability to effectivly use Flexbox to create a modern website. Although there are a few bugs when resizing windows and a little bit of spagetti code, I think I did pretty well and am excited to learn javascript next!
